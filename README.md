# HestiaCP&utdot;Command Creator

The Command Creator is [my](https://hemk.es/) personal side project. This generator supports 
the selection of the required control panel features. The installation command is 
generated via the selection.

The Command Creator is written in Vue3 with Vite and the oruga-ui theme package.
