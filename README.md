# HestiaCP&utdot;Command Creator

The Command Creator is my personal side project for a new server installation with the HestiaCP Control Panel. 
Via the feature selection the generator creates an installation command for the HestiaCP control panel.

The Command Creator is written in Vue3 with Vite and the oruga-ui theme package.
